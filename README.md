The controller is composed by a power supply 24Vdc, 4 LED drives dimmable, a plastic shell 3D printed and a PCB with a Wemos D1 mini, a RTC DS3132 and a DC-DC converter to feed the Wemos and the RTC.

It manages 4 lamps. It has a webpage as human interface and it has a RTC on board.
In case of RTC not working or router not available the lamps continue to work properly
